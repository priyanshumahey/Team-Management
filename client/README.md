# Frontend

The frontend is built with Vite and TypeScript. To run for the first time, run:

``` shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

From then on `npm run dev` will run the server for the frontend.

The frontend is also integrated with Storybook which is designed to allow us to separately visualize and observe each component that we build.

To run storybook run the command `npm run storybook`. This will open a separate storybook port.
